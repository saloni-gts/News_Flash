# news_daily

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The app features a splash screen with a logo in SVG format and text. After the splash screen, the home screen displays a list of all news articles. At the top of the home screen, there is a horizontally scrollable list from which users can select their preferred news category by tapping on a button.

Users can view news details by tapping on a news container, which navigates them to the news detail screen. This screen displays the image, title, and description of the news. Additionally, there is a 'Read More' button that redirects users to the web to read the complete news article.

The home page also includes a floating button with a settings icon. Tapping this button navigates users to the settings page. The settings page offers two options: a switch to enable or disable dark mode and a dropdown menu to select and change the language.

An additional functionality of the app is handling no internet conditions.
